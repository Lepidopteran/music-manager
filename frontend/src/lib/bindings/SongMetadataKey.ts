 * The Item Keys that a [`Tag`](lofty::tag::Tag) can have, essentially is the same as Lofty's [`ItemKey`](lofty::tag::ItemKey) but copies some names from [MusicBrainz Picard Tag Mapping](https://picard-docs.musicbrainz.org/downloads/MusicBrainz_Picard_Tag_Map.html) spec.
 *
 * Additionally, this enum has the [`Serialize`](serde::Serialize) and [`Deserialize`](serde::Deserialize) traits implemented and maps to and from Lofty [`ItemKey`](lofty::tag::ItemKey).
